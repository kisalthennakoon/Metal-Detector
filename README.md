# Waveform Wonders Metal Detector Project

Welcome to the Waveform Wonders Metal Detector project repository! üåê

## Project Overview

This repository showcases the collaborative efforts of our talented team ‚Äì Avinda Shamal, Thamirawaran, Rajitha, and I myself. Together, we've developed an advanced Very Low Frequency (VLF) metal detector, emphasizing precision, functionality, and user-friendliness.

## Key Features

- **Frequency Precision:** Our metal detector operates at 55kHz, ensuring accurate and efficient metal detection.

- **Depth Detection:** Uncover metals hidden up to 30cm below the surface with our state-of-the-art device.

- **Metal Classification:** Distinguish between ferrous and non-ferrous metals, enhancing practicality.

- **User-Friendly Display:** Real-time results are showcased on a vibrant LED blue display for easy interpretation.

## Technologies Used

- **SolidWorks:** The sleek enclosure of our metal detector was meticulously designed using SolidWorks for an optimal blend of aesthetics and functionality.

- **Altium Designer:** The core of our innovation lies in the Printed Circuit Board (PCB), crafted with precision using Altium Designer.
